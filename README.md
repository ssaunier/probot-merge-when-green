### Configuration

Merge when green supports both Checks and Statuses. You can configure which ones must pass for the PR to be considered
"green" in order for it to be merged. Create a `.github/merge-when-green.yml` file to list the require checks/statuses:

```yaml
requiredChecks:
  - circleci
  - travis-ci
# - github # For custom GitHub Action check
requiredStatuses:
  - jenkins
```

By default, Merge when green will wait for [branch protection](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches)
to pass and also require `circleci` and `travis-ci` before attempting to merge.

Merge when green also allows you to ensure that all requested reviews have approved the pull request. Just add the
following to your `.github/merge-when-green.yml`:

```yaml
requireApprovalFromRequestedReviewers: true
```

You can change method that Merge when green uses to merge pull requests with the `mergeMethod` option. Valid values are
`merge`, `squash` and `rebase`, the default is `merge`.

```yaml
mergeMethod: squash
```
